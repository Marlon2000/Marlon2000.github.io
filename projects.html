                        <p>
                            This card game is written in the object-oriented based language Java.
                            A detailed planning and a good implementation had to be done, in order to get everything working fine.
                            All the classes have to interact with each other and all the cards need to be properly displayed.
                            So it took me a long time to find out how all the different classes should interact with each other. 
                            Also I had to consider all the rules, which I had to implement afterwards.
                            But now as it is done I am quite happy with the overall result.

                        <p>
                            A 2D-based platform game, where you go through an adventure with your character Chappie.
                            This game is written in Java. It is written without OpenGL so it was a hard path to finish it.
                            But since game development is a bit more motivating in my opinion I was able to spend much free time in it.
                            So now it's just finished and works fine on any PC, even low-end systems. 
                            I did also implement some enemies and traps to make the game overall more challenging.

                        <p>
                            Due to lack of time still in development. I really look forward to finish and publish it.
                            Want to play with your friends the latest and greatest tactic-based game.
                            So you found the right place here, just donate me 10k and you will get the alpha version. 
                            This game will be able to run on any android device. And I hope you will appreciate the effort,
                            which has been put in since game development is completely different from regular apps development.
